    <h3>Why do we need Scrum Masters to be technical?</h3>
    <p>
        I think it's too common for Scrum Master to be non-technical.<br>
        I'd compare it to a trainer of soccer who doesn't know a lot about game. Isn't it absurd?<br>
        ScrumMaster is a secialist in processes and soft skills currently, but it should be required to<br> learn a lot
        about domain and technical skills.
        It's obvious it's important, but it's not a case too often<br>
        It's important to be efficient in both soccer and in software development, but it isn't main goal - main goal is
        to create value.
