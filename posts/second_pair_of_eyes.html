        <h4>Why do we need Scrum Masters to be technical?</h4>
	<p>
	    I think it's too common for Scrum Master to be non-technical.<br>
	    I'd compare it to a trainer of soccer who doesn't know a lot about game. Isn't it absurd?<br>
    	    ScrumMaster is specialist in processes and soft skills currently, <b>but</b> it should be required to learn a lot about domain and technical skills.
	    It's obvious it's important, but it's not a case too often<br>
	    It's important to be efficient in both soccer and in software development, but it isn't main goal - main goal is to create value.
